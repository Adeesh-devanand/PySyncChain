PySyncChain is a high-performance, multithreaded, and asynchronous blockchain implemented in Python. It leverages `asyncio` for concurrent transaction processing, `threading` for efficient Proof-of-Work (PoW) mining, and `websockets` for real-time peer-to-peer (P2P) communication.

---

## üöÄ Features  

- **Asynchronous & Multithreaded**: Uses `asyncio` for non-blocking transaction processing and `threading` for parallel mining.  
- **Proof-of-Work (PoW) Mining**: Implements dynamically adjustable mining difficulty.  
- **UTXO-Based Double-Spending Prevention**: Ensures transaction security using unspent transaction outputs.  
- **ECDSA Digital Signatures**: Uses public-private key cryptography to authorize transactions.  
- **WebSockets for P2P Communication**: Supports real-time blockchain synchronization across nodes.  
- **Fault-Tolerant Peer Discovery**: Dynamically updates peer lists to maintain network consistency.  

---

## üèó Installation  

### Prerequisites  

- Python 3.8+  
- WebSockets library (`pip install websockets`)  
- ECDSA library (`pip install ecdsa`)  
- OpenSSL for cryptographic operations  

### Steps  

1. Clone the repository:  

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PySyncChain.git
  cd PySyncChain
  ```

2. Install dependencies:  

  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

3. Run a blockchain node:  

  ```
  python blockchain.py
  ```

4. Start a miner:  

  ```
  python miner.py
  ```

5. Run a second node for P2P communication:  

  ```
  python blockchain.py --peer ws://localhost:5000
  ```

---

## üìñ Usage  

- **Check blockchain status:**  
  ```
  python cli.py --status
  ```  

- **Create and broadcast a transaction:**  
  ```
  python cli.py --send --from <wallet_address> --to <recipient_address> --amount <value>
  ```

- **Start mining:**  
  ```
  python cli.py --mine
  ```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration  

Modify `config.json` to adjust mining difficulty, peer discovery settings, and network ports.  

```
{
  "mining_difficulty": 4,
  "p2p_port": 5000,
  "peer_discovery": true,
  "enable_logging": true
}
```

## ‚õèÔ∏è Mining & Multithreading  

1. **Proof-of-Work (PoW) Algorithm** - Miners solve a cryptographic puzzle based on a **difficulty target**.  
2. **Multithreaded Mining** - Uses Python‚Äôs `threading` to offload PoW computation to a separate worker thread.  
3. **Longest Chain Rule** - Nodes always follow the **chain with the most cumulative Proof-of-Work**.  

### **Mining a New Block (Multithreading Implementation)**  
```
import threading

def mine_block(block):
    while not block.hash.startswith("0" * difficulty):
        block.nonce += 1
        block.hash = block.compute_hash()

# Run mining in a separate thread
mining_thread = threading.Thread(target=mine_block, args=(block,))
mining_thread.start()
```  

---

## üåê Peer-to-Peer Networking  

Nodes communicate using **WebSockets**, allowing real-time **block broadcasting and chain synchronization**.  

### **Broadcast a New Block**  
```
async def broadcast_block(self, block):
    for peer in PEERS.copy():
        try:
            async with websockets.connect(f"ws://{peer}") as websocket:
                await websocket.send(json.dumps(block.__dict__))
        except:
            PEERS.remove(peer)
```  

### **Request Blockchain from Peers**  
```
async def sync_with_peers(self):
    for peer in PEERS:
        async with websockets.connect(peer) as websocket:
            await websocket.send(json.dumps({"action": "request_chain"}))
            response = await websocket.recv()
            new_chain = json.loads(response)
            if len(new_chain) > len(self.chain):
                self.chain = [Block(**block) for block in new_chain]
                self.save_chain_to_file()
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security  

- **ECDSA Digital Signatures**: Prevents unauthorized transactions.  
- **UTXO Model**: Ensures coins cannot be double-spent.  
- **Block Validation Rules**: Rejects invalid or tampered blocks.  
- **Automatic Peer Blacklisting**: Removes inactive or malicious peers.
